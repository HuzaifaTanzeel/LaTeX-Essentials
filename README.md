## Introduction
LaTeX is a powerful typesetting system commonly used for creating documents with complex formatting. In this workshop, you will learn the basics of LaTeX and how to create beautifully formatted documents.

## Getting Started
Before we dive into LaTeX, make sure you have it installed on your system. You can download LaTeX distributions like TeX Live or MiKTeX. We will also use an integrated development environment (IDE) like TeXShop or Overleaf.

### LaTeX Tags
- Installation: `\usepackage{package-name}`
- IDEs: TeXShop, Overleaf

## Basic Document Structure
In LaTeX, a document consists of a preamble and the document body. We will cover the basic structure of a LaTeX document.

### LaTeX Tags
- Document Class: `\documentclass{class}`
- Preamble: `\begin{document}`
- Title and Author: `\title{}` and `\author{}`
- Sections and Chapters: `\section{}` and `\chapter{}`

## Formatting Text
LaTeX provides various commands for text formatting, such as font styles, sizes, and text alignment.

### LaTeX Tags
- Font Styles: `\textbf{}` (bold), `\textit{}` (italic)
- Font Sizes: `\tiny`, `\small`, `\large`
- Text Alignment: `\centering`, `\raggedleft`

## Mathematics
LaTeX is widely used in scientific and mathematical documents. You will learn how to write mathematical expressions and equations.

### LaTeX Tags
- Inline Math: `$...$`
- Display Math: `\[...\]`
- Mathematical Symbols: `\frac{}`, `\sum`, `\sqrt{}`, `\int`

## Lists
Lists are a common part of documents. LaTeX allows you to create both ordered and unordered lists.

### LaTeX Tags
- Unordered List: `\begin{itemize} \item ... \end{itemize}`
- Ordered List: `\begin{enumerate} \item ... \end{enumerate}`

## Tables
Tables are essential for presenting data in a structured way. You will learn how to create tables in LaTeX.

### LaTeX Tags
- Table Environment: `\begin{tabular} ... \end{tabular}`
- Column Alignment: `c`, `l`, `r`
- Adding Borders: `\hline`

## Figures and Images
LaTeX makes it easy to insert figures and images into your documents.

### LaTeX Tags
- Inserting a Figure: `\begin{figure} \includegraphics{image-file} \end{figure}`
- Figure Captions: `\caption{Your caption}`

## References and Citations
Learn how to create and manage references and citations using BibTeX.

### LaTeX Tags
- Citation: `\cite{key}`
- BibTeX File: `\bibliography{bibfile}`
- Citation Style: `\bibliographystyle{style}`
